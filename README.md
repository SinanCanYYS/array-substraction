Array Subtraction

Introduction/General Preview

The Array Subtraction library is a utility that allows you to extract one array from another. It provides a function called arrayDiff(a, b) that takes two arrays, a and b, as input and returns a new array that contains the elements from a that are not present in b. This library is useful when you need to find the difference between two arrays and obtain the unique elements from one array that are not found in the other.

Installation

You can install the Array Subtraction library via npm. Open your terminal and run the following command:

<!-- npm install array-subtraction -->

Usage

To use the Array Subtraction library in your project, you need to require it:


<!-- const arrayDiff = require('array-subtraction'); -->

Once you have imported the library, you can call the arrayDiff(a, b) function to perform the array subtraction. Pass in two arrays, a and b, as arguments, and the function will return a new array with the elements from a that are not present in b.

Here's an example usage:

<!-- const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const b = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7];

const result = arrayDiff(a, b);
console.log(result); // Output: [1, 2] -->
